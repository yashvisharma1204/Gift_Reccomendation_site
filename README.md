## Overview

Welcome to the Gift Recommendation Website repository! This collaborative project, crafted by @Yashvisharma1204, Punit Kumar, and Hardik Choudhary, is a delightful platform designed to assist users in finding the perfect gift recommendations. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we aimed to create a visually pleasing and interactive experience for users.

## Project Highlights

- **HTML:** The homepage boasts a captivating container of images and text, creating a serene atmosphere. A consistent navigation bar elegantly spans across all pages, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

- **CSS:** A calm and inviting white-and-pastel color theme was carefully chosen to enhance the website's ambiance. The visually appealing layout, featuring grid displays on the homepage and gift recommendation pages, prioritizes organization and aesthetics.

- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity, a heart button below each gift recommendation allows users to express appreciation with a simple click. The website includes a user-friendly login page, seamlessly blending functionality with a delightful user experience.
